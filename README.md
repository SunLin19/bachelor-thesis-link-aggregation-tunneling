## Abstract (Taken from Introduction)

In short and colloquial terms this work is about better internet. 
More precisely we evaluate, test and explain a concept and an implementation of a software which aims to provide a more reliable and faster internet connection. The concept is called "OSI Layer 3 Link Aggregation Tunneling" (OL3LAT).
The implementation we are testing and explaining is called "Multipath VPN". OL3LAT works by aggregating several maybe slow or unreliable internet connections together to one fast reliable virtual internet connection.
